(just a very simple readme)

i put together these 2 files because i wanted dirvish like backups, but with snapshots and not too much work. all in all it took me still to much, but thanks to tools like simpledb (http://code.google.com/p/amazon-simpledb-cli/) and the wonderful amazon aws tools i have what i want.

look at the cron example to see how both executables can be called. if you wonder where the verbose strings come from do 'man date' and look for --date.

you need to create your domain: simpledb create-domein snapshot and you need to install simpledb and its required packages. (if you install the amazon perl lib be sure to check the requirements of those packages as well.)

have fun,
